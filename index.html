				<h2>UK</h2>
				<p> I am an Assistant Lecturer for Voice at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire and a
					teacher for Embodied Voice Practice at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, London.</p>
				<p>I also work with poets who need help to speak in public. I have worked for the Ledbury 
					Poetry Festival since 2015 et gave a workshop in Birmingham for Writing Westmidlands in September 2019.</p>

				<h2>World</h2>
				<p>I was born in Belgium, where I trained as an actor in the Conservatoire de Liège. 
					I became a voice teacher in 1993, after training in the USA with Kristin Linklater,
					 the author of Freeing the Natural Voice.
				I performed in Belgium, France, Romania and in the States, and have been teaching voice in Ireland, 
					Portugal, Poland and the UK.</p>
				<p>I directed Toutes Les Chose Géniales (Every Brilliant Thing, Duncan MacMillan) for the Festival de Spa
					(Belgium) in 2018 currently touring in France.</p>

					<h2>Why Voice?</h2>
				<p>Freeing the voice means freeing the person: it it the person we want to hear, not their voice.
					Voice work is psychophysical, it means exploring the way the voice lives in the body, 
					how words emante from the body. The vocal presence has the power to influence the audience 
					and transform the world !</p>
				<p>An example of the voice work I do will include:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Awareness of the physical presence through relaxation and breathing</li>
					<li>Warming up the voice with embodied resonance</li>
					<li>Exploring more of the vocal range</li>
					<li>Waking up the articulation for clear and active speech</li>
					</ul>
