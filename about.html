	<h2>Profile</h2>
	<p>I am an actor, director and voice practitioner who teaches spoken voice and text.
		I was born in Belgium and moved to the UK in 2010. As a young performer I had lots of voice problems
		and those issues reduced my confidence in my acting abilities. I had tight breathing musculature 
		leading to breathiness which caused throat pain, no vocal resonance and headaches while performing.</p>
		It's because of those difficulties and limitations that I became interested in vocal issues. </p>
	<p>I met Kristin Linklater in Belgium in 1985 during a one week voice, sound and movement and text workshop.
		After that workshop I decided to study voice and travelled many times to the US to work with Kristin
		Linklater. I completed the Linklater training in 1993, including movement studies with Trish Arnold.</p>

	<p>The work completely transformed my relationship to my voice and my acting. I started teaching voice
		in the Conservatoire de Li√®ge while performing in classical and and experimental plays. I taught
		in the Conservatoire of Mons until 2010, when I moved to the UK. 
		Other training includes movement studies with Susan Dibble, Lorna Marshall (The Body Speaks) 
		and Merry Conway (The Actor as Instrument)
		Singing with Frankie Armstrong, Venice Manley, Helen Chadwick and Lucy Grauman (Ik Zeg Adieu).
		Voice with Andrea Haring, Cecil McKinnon, Fran Bennett, Cicely Berry and Barbara Houseman.</p>
	<p>I became a visiting lecturer at the RBC in 2011 and have joined the faculty as Assistant Lecturer
		 in Voice in 2017. Here, I teach voice into text for the BA Applied Theatre year 1 and 2, practical 
		 voice on MA Acting, MFA Acting in the British Tradition year 1 and 2 and MA Professional Voice Practice 
		 courses. I also provide vocal support on student productions (BA Applied Performance).</p>
	<p>Since 2017, I teach Embodied voice practice to the Voice Studies Master's students at the Royal Central School of 
		Speech and Drama. In addition to teaching voice, I am providing pastoral, academic and pedagogical
		support to the students including supervising Postgraduate research project in acting. </p>
	<p>Outside
		the conservatoire training setting, I am translating into French Kristin Linklater's book 
		"Freeing the Natural Voice" and working as a theatre director.</p>
